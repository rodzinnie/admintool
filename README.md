### Branch naming convention:

`feat/[ticket-number]` - for new features

`fix/[ticket-number]` - for bug fixes

### File naming convention: 

- naming convention: `src/components/[appropriate location i.e. 'common']/[ComponentName]/index.tsx`
- add the new export to root index file

### Git flow

1. Create new branch
1. Add functionality
1. Commit changes
1. Push changes
1. Create pull request
1. Assign reviewer
1. Wait for acceptance (CR)
1. Squash commits
1. Merge to master

### Current branch protections in place: 
1. `master` - to merge your code to the master branch, you have to request a review from at least 1 collaborator, other than the last pusher.
